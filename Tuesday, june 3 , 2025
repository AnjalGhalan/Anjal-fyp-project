This week I did:

- Learned about Django and started making the main parts (models, views, admin).

- Found articles and took notes for my literature review.

Next week I will:

- Finish making the Django models and connect to the database.

- Start designing the website layout.

- Organize my notes and start writing the literature review.







What is Django Framework?
Django is a Python web framework that helps you build web applications quickly and easily. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern (called Model-View-Template in Django) to separate the data (Model), the user interface (Template), and the business logic (View). It has built-in features like an admin panel, database management, and security tools which make web development faster.

Main Parts of Your Merit & Demerit System Project
1. Models (Data Structure)
Models are Python classes that define your database tables. For a merit-demerit system, you might have models like:

python
Copy
Edit
from django.db import models

class Student(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    roll_number = models.CharField(max_length=20, unique=True)

class Merit(models.Model):
    student = models.ForeignKey(Student, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    reason = models.TextField()
    points = models.IntegerField()
    date = models.DateField(auto_now_add=True)

class Demerit(models.Model):
    student = models.ForeignKey(Student, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    reason = models.TextField()
    points = models.IntegerField()
    date = models.DateField(auto_now_add=True)
2. Views (Logic to display data)
Views handle the user requests and return responses. A simple example to list merits might be:

python
Copy
Edit
from django.shortcuts import render
from .models import Merit

def merit_list(request):
    merits = Merit.objects.all()
    return render(request, 'merit_list.html', {'merits': merits})
3. Admin Panel Setup (Manage data easily)
Django comes with a built-in admin panel where you can manage your data without building UI from scratch. Register your models like this:

python
Copy
Edit
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Student, Merit, Demerit

admin.site.register(Student)
admin.site.register(Merit)
admin.site.register(Demerit)
Literature Review Work
Collected research articles and papers related to merit and demerit systems in schools or organizations.

Reviewed how other systems track behavior, assign points, and generate reports.

Took notes on important points such as the criteria for awarding merits and demerits, user interface designs, and common challenges faced in these systems.
