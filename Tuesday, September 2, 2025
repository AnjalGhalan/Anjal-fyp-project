What I did:
Successfully registered models (Student, Merit, Demerit) into the Django admin panel.
Tested user registration, login, and logout functionality.
Verified that pages (Home, Login, Register, Dashboard, Admin) are working properly.


To Do:
Add pages to display Merit and Demerit records for students.
Create a profile page where students can view their own records.
Improve the dashboard with simple statistics (total merits/demerits).
