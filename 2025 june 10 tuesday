âœ… Weekly Log (This Week)
What I did:

- Finished making the Django models and connected them to the SQLite database.

- Designed a simple layout of the website (home page, login, and dashboard wireframe).

- Organized all literature review notes and started writing the first draft.


ðŸ“Œ Next Week Plan
To Do:

- Implement user authentication (login/logout) using Django.

- Start frontend pages using HTML, CSS (Home, Login, Dashboard).

- Finish first draft of the literature review for documentation.









ðŸ§¾ Simple Proof of Work
âœ… 1. Django Models (Completed)
python
Copy
Edit
from django.db import models

class Student(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    roll_number = models.CharField(max_length=20, unique=True)

class Merit(models.Model):
    student = models.ForeignKey(Student, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    reason = models.TextField()
    points = models.IntegerField()
    date = models.DateField(auto_now_add=True)

class Demerit(models.Model):
    student = models.ForeignKey(Student, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    reason = models.TextField()
    points = models.IntegerField()
    date = models.DateField(auto_now_add=True)
âœ… 2. Database Connection (SQLite - default)
Confirmed models.py is migrated successfully:

bash
Copy
Edit
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
âœ… 3. Website Layout (Simple Design)
Wireframe layout:

Home Page: Project title + login

Login Page: Role-based (Student / Admin / Teacher)

Dashboard: Table view of merits/demerits, add new record button

(You can show a hand-drawn or Figma layout screenshot for proof if needed)

âœ… 4. Literature Review Notes
Summarized 3 articles discussing behavior monitoring in schools.

Key points noted:

Point-based tracking improves discipline.

Importance of role-based access.

Need for automated reporting tools.
